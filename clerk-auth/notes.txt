B. Communication with Clerk Microservice

Frontend → Clerk Microservice:
Users interact with Clerk’s UI (via SDK or custom UI) on the frontend.
This interaction calls Clerk's hosted API directly for auth workflows (login, registration).
After successful login, the frontend gets a session token (JWT).


Backend → Clerk Microservice:
The backend verifies session tokens by sending them to the Clerk microservice.
Example:
Frontend sends a request to the backend with the token.
Backend forwards this token to the Clerk microservice for validation.
Clerk microservice responds with user details or error if the token is invalid.


Clerk Microservice → Clerk API:
The Clerk microservice communicates with Clerk’s hosted API to:
Validate tokens.
Fetch user metadata.
Perform user management operations (if required).
